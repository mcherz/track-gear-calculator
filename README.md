track-gear-calculator
=====================

A calculator for track cycling gears. Works in both directions: set a chainring and cog, see the gear, or set the gear, see the chainring and cog.

A word of warning: I'km a designer, not a developer. So my code is seldom good and never great. It's poorly commented, poorly organized, and overly complicated. But it works, so there's that.

The realy magic here is in inchesTouchSetup(); that's where the swipe handling happens.

Feel free to integrate this into your site, but please credit back to me, and if you're feeling particularly generous, please link to the iOS native application (which was the original) at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/track-gear-calculator/id725953062

Thanks for playing!
